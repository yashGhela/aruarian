#Aruarian is a natural language AI tool to interact with your to-do list, the project is currently still available at: https://aruarianai.xyz/

In 2024, with an interest in AI I built a tool to manage my to-dos in natural language. The tool allowed users to text/communicate with an AI bot in natural language that would then convert that natural language into database instructions. Along with that the AI tool could spontaneously remind a user of their to-dos and help them rearrange their schedule based on the day. This project used NextJS, supabase and the Replicate API with Meta LLama 3
